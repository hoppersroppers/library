# Roppers Things Worth Doing to Get Better:

This is a rough list of things to do so you get better. 

## Get Good at Security: 


## Random Things Worth Doing:

* Set up a Security Onion instance and learn every single tool on it
  * No seriously. Do this. 
* Set up Kali and Metasploitable and learn how to use Metasploit, but only so that you can create good logs for security onion
  * At least 95% of security jobs are purely defensive. Practice like you play. this is the single most beneficial thing you can do.
*	Do all the labs on this site: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/
*	Set up a honeypot that faces the internet and do something with what you catch

If you have done all of these things, documented them and can talk about them well, make it to an interview and don't get the job, let me know. Everything else on this page is gravy.

## Get Good at Programming:

Personally I think this is as important as getting good at security, but the other stuff is way more fun, plus it's easier to put on your resume and talk about in your interview.
