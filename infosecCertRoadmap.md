# What Infosec Certs Do I Need to Get Hired 

We don't love that we need certs, but here is a roadmap you can use to guide your certification path. Here we will focus on getting the most commonly sought by employers, namely the Comptia certs.

By the end of these you should seek to have Security+ and Network+, and be starting work on any further certs for the role you want to go towards. If you want to seek out A+, it's worth doing, but not nessecary for many jobs. 

### [Computing Fundamentals](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html) 

This is Ropper's flagship course and will teach you most of what you need to know to be successful, no matter what your starting experience is. Taking you from installing your first Virtual Machine and writing your first python script, to learning advanced Linux sysadmin knowledge and coding complex networking tasks, this course is zero to hero in a very fun manner. You have the understanding required to pass A+ after this, but that all comes down to your study habits and the time you put in to memorizing. 
  
### [Security Fundamentals](training/security.md) 

In this course we will provide the context needed to develop a technical understanding of security and how different roles fit into this. It is highly recommended that the student follows this course with [Professor Messer's Comptia Security+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/sy0-501-training-course/). Remember, passing certs is more about how well you study for it, than total understanding so really dive into Anki decks such as [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2145089484) and [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/352022978), as well as the many study guides out there freely available.

### [Networking Fundamentals(IP)](training/networking.md)

In this course you will learn how networking works at a practical level before you go and hit the books to learn networking on a theoretical level like is required for the Comptia Network+ course. Again, once you finish the Ropper's practical material, use [Professor Messer's Comptia Network Course](https://www.professormesser.com/netplus-resources/). This is the blend of practical experience and theoretical knowledge that will make you both very skilled and very knowledgeable. Just like for Security, focus on studying more than watching videos, so that means Anki decks and study guides, but don't forget to load up Wireshark and look at those packets as you go along.

### [Capture the Flag Basics](training/ctf.md)

CTF's won't get you hired, but it will teach you a lot of material very quickly, as well as be a super entertaining way to do it. 

 * [Cryptography Fundamentals](training/crypto.md)
 * [Forensics Fundamentals(IP)](training/forensics.md)

This is about the level you should be at to start looking at intermediate certs like Pentest+, Certified Ethical Hacker, or Cybersecurity Analyst+.
